Build reproducible data and AI pipelines with executable Markdown

## What is Spry?

Spry is a powerful tool that transforms Markdown documents into executable data pipelines. It combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of code execution, enabling you to create reproducible, well-documented workflows for data engineering and AI applications.

With Spry, your documentation becomes your application. Write code blocks in Markdown, define dependencies, and let Spry orchestrate the execution automatically.
