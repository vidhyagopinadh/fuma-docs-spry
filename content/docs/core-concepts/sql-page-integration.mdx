Learn how Spry generates and manages SQLPage applications.

## What is SQLPage?

SQLPage is a framework for building database-driven web applications using only SQL. Spry makes it even easier by letting you define entire SQLPage apps in Markdown.

## Creating Routes

SQL code blocks automatically become SQLPage routes:

````markdown
```sql index.sql
SELECT 'hero' AS component,
       'Welcome to My App' AS title,
       'Built with Spry and SQLPage' AS description;
```

```sql about.sql
SELECT 'text' AS component,
       'About Us' AS title,
       'Learn more about our company' AS contents;
```
````

These create routes at `/` and `/about`.

## Custom Routes

Use metadata to specify custom route paths:

````markdown
```sql admin-users.sql { route: '/admin/users' }
SELECT 'table' AS component;
SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE role = 'admin';
```
````

## Development vs Production

Spry supports two deployment modes:

<Tabs items={['File System Mode', 'Database Mode']}>
  <Tab value="File System Mode">
    ### File System Mode (Development)
    
    Generate `.sql` files to a directory. Fast iteration with `--watch`:
    
    ```bash
    ./spry.ts spc --fs dev-src.auto --watch
    ```
    
    Perfect for rapid development with live reloading.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="Database Mode">
    ### Database Mode (Production)
    
    Store routes directly in the database. Single-database deployment:
    
    ```bash
    ./spry.ts task deploy
    ```
    
    Ideal for production deployments with all routes in the database.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Automatic Navigation

Spry can automatically generate navigation menus based on your routes:

````markdown
```sql _navigation.sql
SELECT 'menu' AS component;
${md.navigation()}
```
````

## SQLPage Components

Use all standard SQLPage components in your routes:

````markdown
```sql dashboard.sql
-- Hero section
SELECT 'hero' AS component,
       'Dashboard' AS title;

-- Statistics cards
SELECT 'card' AS component, 3 AS columns;
SELECT 'Users' AS title, 
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users) AS value;
SELECT 'Products' AS title,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products) AS value;
SELECT 'Orders' AS title,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders) AS value;

-- Recent activity table
SELECT 'table' AS component;
SELECT * FROM recent_activity LIMIT 10;
```
````

<Callout type="info">
Check the [SQLPage documentation](https://sql.ophir.dev/documentation.sql) for all available components.
</Callout>

## Configuration

Configure SQLPage behavior in `sqlpage/sqlpage.json`:

```json
{
  "database_url": "sqlite://app.db",
  "port": 8080,
  "site_title": "My Spry App",
  "site_prefix": "",
  "max_uploaded_file_size": 10485760
}
```
