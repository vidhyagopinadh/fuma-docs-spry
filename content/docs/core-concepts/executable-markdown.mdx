## What is Executable Markdown?

In Spry, fenced code blocks in your Markdown files become executable cells. Each code block can:

- Execute code in multiple languages (SQL, Bash, TypeScript, Python)
- Define dependencies on other code blocks
- Include metadata for routing and caching
- Be named and referenced throughout your pipeline

## Basic Syntax

A basic executable code block looks like this:

````markdown
```bash
echo "Hello from Spry!"
```
````

## Named Tasks

Give your code blocks names to reference them elsewhere:

````markdown
```bash setup-db
sqlite3 app.db < schema.sql
```
````

The task name comes after the language identifier.

## Directives

Directives are special flags that control how code blocks are executed:

### --descr

Add a description to your task:

````markdown
```bash setup-db --descr "Initialize the database"
sqlite3 app.db < schema.sql
```
````

### --dep

Define dependencies on other tasks:

````markdown
```bash seed-data --dep setup-db
sqlite3 app.db < seed.sql
```
````

<Callout>
This task will only run after `setup-db` completes successfully.
</Callout>

### Multiple Dependencies

Tasks can depend on multiple other tasks:

````markdown
```bash deploy --dep setup-db --dep seed-data
echo "Deployment complete"
```
````

## SQL Code Blocks

SQL code blocks are special - they can become SQLPage routes:

````markdown
```sql index.sql
SELECT 'hero' AS component,
       'Welcome!' AS title,
       'Build apps with Spry' AS description;
```
````

The filename (e.g., `index.sql`) becomes the route path.

## Metadata

Add JSON5 metadata to control routing and other behaviors:

````markdown
```sql users.sql { route: '/admin/users', cache: 300 }
SELECT 'table' AS component;
SELECT id, name, email FROM users;
```
````

## Supported Languages

<Cards>
  <Card title="SQL">
    Primary language for SQLPage routes and database operations
  </Card>

  <Card title="Bash">
    Shell commands for setup, deployment, and file operations
  </Card>

  <Card title="TypeScript">
    Complex logic, API calls, and data transformations
  </Card>

  <Card title="Python">
    Data analysis, ML, and scientific computing tasks
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Complete Example

Here's a complete example showing multiple features:

````markdown
# My Application

## Setup Tasks
```bash create-db --descr "Create database file"
rm -f app.db && touch app.db
```

```bash setup-schema --dep create-db --descr "Setup schema"
sqlite3 app.db < schema.sql
```

## Application Routes
```sql index.sql { route: '/' }
SELECT 'hero' AS component,
       'My App' AS title;
```

```sql users.sql { route: '/users', cache: 60 }
SELECT 'table' AS component;
SELECT * FROM users;
```
