## Common Issues

### Installation Problems

If you're having trouble installing Spry:

```bash
# Ensure you have Deno 2.5+ installed
deno --version

# Run Spry initializer
cd <your-project>
deno run --node-modules-dir=auto -A https://raw.githubusercontent.com/programmablemd/spry/main/lib/sqlpage/cli.ts init
```

### Spryfile.md Not Executing

Make sure your code blocks have the correct language identifiers and attributes:

````md
```sql {.store-result}
SELECT * FROM users;
```
````

### SQLPage Integration Issues

For SQLPage-related problems:

- Verify your `sqlpage/sqlpage.json` configuration
- Check that `dev-src.auto/` directory is being generated
- Ensure database connection strings are correct

### Performance Issues

For large Markdown files or complex workflows:

- Break content into smaller, focused `Spryfile.md` documents
- Use task dependencies efficiently
- Monitor execution with `--watch` during development
